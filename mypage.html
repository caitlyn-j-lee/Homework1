        <h1>Lee, Caitlyn</h1>
        <p>Interesting Facts:
          <br>1. I am the Ambassador of CU CHAARG, a club on campus.
          <br>2. My favorite color is black.
          <br>3. I love watermelon.
          <br>
          <br>I am studying computer science because I have always been good with technology. My parents pushed me to try it out.
          <br>I fell in love with the problem solving aspect of coding. Technology isn't going anyway so it's a field that can easily
          <br>apply to other fields that I'm interested in as well.
